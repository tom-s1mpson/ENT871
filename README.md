This is the supplementary material for the ENT871 Micro and Nano Engineering module as part of EPSRC's CDT for Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing. This repository contains the raw data files measured aswell as the analysis/plotting in Python. To run the data files and the Python files should be in the same location.

**List of figures:**

**Figure 3:** HEMT output characteristics where the labels indicated different VGS values from 0 V to −8 V in 1 V steps. For VGS < VP, IDS ≈ 0. The grey dotted lines indicate the saturation current and the pink line is an approximate boundary between the linear region and the saturation region defined by VDS = VGS − VT.
